== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. The default task runs
the entire test suite for all classes. For more information, checkout the 
full array of rake tasks with "rake -T"

Rake can be found at http://rake.rubyforge.org

== Running by hand

If you only want to run a single test suite, or don't want to bother with Rake,
you can do so with something like:

   ruby controller/base_test.rb
