			<h2>Welcome to Rails</h2>
<p>
Rails is a web-application and persistance framework that includes
everything needed to create database-backed web-applications according to
the Model-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view
(also called the presentation) into &quot;dumb&quot; templates that are
primarily responsible for inserting pre-build data in between HTML tags.
The model contains the &quot;smart&quot; domain objects (such as Account,
Product, Person, Post) that holds all the business logic and knows how to
persist themselves to a database. The controller handles the incoming
requests (such as Save New Account, Update Product, Show Post) by
manipulating the model and directing data to the view.
</p>
<p>
In Rails, the model is handled by what&#8217;s called a object-relational
mapping layer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the
data from database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with
business logic methods. You can read more about Active Record in <a
href="vendor/activerecord/README.html">vendor/activerecord/README.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
The controller and view is handled by the Action Pack, which handles both
layers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two
layers are bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence.
This is unlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack
that is much more separate. Each of these packages can be used
independently outside of Rails. You can read more about Action Pack in <a
href="vendor/actionpack/README.html">vendor/actionpack/README.html</a>.
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Apache 1.3.x or 2.x (or any FastCGI-capable webserver with a
mod_rewrite-like module)

</li>
<li>FastCGI (or mod_ruby) for production performance (CGI is used for
development)

</li>
<li>Database and driver (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<ol>
<li>Setup Apache for the Rails application (see &quot;Example for Apache
conf&quot;)

</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://rails">rails</a>/ (or whatever is your ServerName)
and check that you get the &quot;Congratulations, you&#8217;re on
Rails!&quot; screen

</li>
<li>Follow the guidelines on the &quot;Congratulations, you&#8217;re on
Rails!&quot; screen

</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example for Apache conf</h2>
<pre>
  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName rails
    DocumentRoot /path/tapplication/public/
    ErrorLog /path/application/log/apache.log

    &lt;Directory /path/application/public/&gt;
      Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride all
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
  &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
<p>
NOTE: Be sure that CGIs can be executed in that directory as well. So
ExecCGI should be on and &quot;.cgi&quot; should respond. All requests from
127.0.0.1 goes through CGI, so no Apache restart is necessary for changes.
All other requests goes through FCGI (or mod_ruby) that requires restart to
show changes.
</p>
<h2>Debugging Rails</h2>
<p>
Have &quot;tail -f&quot; commands running on both the apache.log,
production.log, and test.log files. Rails will automatically display
debugging and runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also
be shown in the browser on requests from 127.0.0.1.
</p>
<h2>Description of contents</h2>
<p>
app
</p>
<pre>
  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.
</pre>
<p>
app/controllers
</p>
<pre>
  Holds controllers that should be named like weblog_controller.rb for
  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descent from
  ActionController::Base.
</pre>
<p>
app/models
</p>
<pre>
  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.
  Most models will descent from ActiveRecord::Base.
</pre>
<p>
app/views
</p>
<pre>
  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
  weblog/index.rhtml for the WeblogController#index action. All views uses eRuby
  syntax. This directory can also be used to keep stylesheets, images, and so on
  that can be symlinked to public.
</pre>
<p>
app/helpers
</p>
<pre>
  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblog_helper.rb.
</pre>
<p>
config
</p>
<pre>
  Configuration files for Apache, database, and other dependencies.
</pre>
<p>
public
</p>
<pre>
  The directory available for Apache, which includes symbolic links to other
  parts of the structure that are to be made available. Refrain from placing
  actual files in here if you're using CVS and don't want to check in this
  directory.
</pre>
<p>
script
</p>
<pre>
  Helper scripts for automation and generation.
</pre>
<p>
test
</p>
<pre>
  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures.
</pre>
<p>
vendor
</p>
<pre>
  External libraries that the application depend on.
</pre>
